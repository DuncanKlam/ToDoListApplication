User stories
As a student, I need to keep up with many tasks and assignments for the different classes I am enrolled in. I need a consolidated list of all my to-dos for all my classes.
  I can set reminders to complete to-dos before the due date.
  I can mark to-dos as completed or snooze the to-dos.
  I can know exactly when a to-do item is created and completed.
  I want notifications to happen when the app is opened and due dates come up.
As an important employee, I want to keep up-to-date copies of my work on the cloud so I don’t lose my information.
  I can save items to the cloud and load items from the cloud.
  I want a sync button so I can keep my local workspace consistent with my cloud content.
  My sync button backs up cloud items to the device.
  My sync button continues working offline when there is no connection.
As an HR manager, I want to see a pie chart of my statistics from item snoozing and completion so I can track the efficiency of my team.
  I can see the statistics from the app in a pie chart
  I can see the number of all items
  I can see the number of completed items
  I can see the number of overdue items
  I can see the number of pending items
